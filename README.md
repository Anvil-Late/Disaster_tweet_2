# Disaster tweets

This is my second take at the [“Real or Not ? NLP with Disaster Tweets” Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview).

Last time, I was a rather junior data scientist. I focused heavily on feature engineering and bags of words to put into machine learning model, and managed to obtain a decent score of 78% with ensemble models.

Now, 6 months later, I am more familiar with NLP, and especially with word embeddings, as well as with neural networks. I'll use these more advanced methods to see if I can obtain better scores than last time, and see how far I have progressed.
